# AgriSight — Agricultural E-commerce Sales Analysis & Prediction System

> A market intelligence platform for agricultural product sellers, built on scraped e-commerce data from Chinese platforms. Combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and an interactive web dashboard to surface actionable pricing and sales insights.

---

## Project Overview

AgriSight is a data-driven web application that collects, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes agricultural product sales data from public e-commerce platforms (JD.com / Taobao). It is designed as both a **graduation project deliverable** (data analysis training — Topic 3, medium difficulty) and a **realistic B2B market intelligence tool** for agricultural sellers who want to understand pricing dynamics, competition, and demand patterns.

The system answers questions like:
- Which product categories sell the most, and at what price points?
- Does promotion status significantly lift sales volume?
- Which origin regions dominate which categories?
- Given my product's attributes, what sales volume can I expect?

## Business Framing

Rather than presenting this as a student analysis exercise, AgriSight is framed as a **Seller Intelligence Dashboard** — a tool an agricultural merchant would realistically pay to use. Key value propositions:

- **Benchmark your product** against competitors in the same category and price range
- **Predict expected sales** before setting a price
- **Understand what drives sales** through transparent regression and factor analysis
- **Discover underserved niches** via cluster analysis (high-rating, low-competition segments)
